DSL Compiler Collection is like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/). On Steroids.

# DSL Compiler Collection

We believe, it is high time for a paradigm shift in the software development industry. Software development, as we know today, is slow, expensive, and the outcome is usually questionable. 

We envision a perfectly lean industry without any waste.

Our mission is to make software development easier and quicker by requiring no or minimal code as we know it today. 

# Concept

## Domain
DSL Compiler Collection is a collection of compilers for domain specific languages. A domain specific languages is a language specialized to a particular domain. Domain is a sphere of knowledge; the subject area to which one developes a software. The ubiquitous language is a language structured around the domain, used unanimously by every participant to connect all the entities and activities of the domain unambiguously. 

## Entity
An entity is the single, definitive source of truth about every nouns of your ubiquitous language. An entity has separate and distinct existence and objective or conceptual reality as contrasted with its attributes. An attribute is a quality, character, or characteristic ascribed to the enity.

## Activity
An activity is the single, definitive source of truth about every verbs of your ubiquitous language.
